Hello, my name is Stanislav Ossovskiy. I am a Doctor of Musical Arts and the inventor of an innovative electronic assistive device which utilized a principle widely spread in nature – the principle of bio echolocation (biological sonar, used by several kinds of animals). My rationale behind that idea is that animals (at least the species I am aware of), which rely on echolocation, are capable of producing and distinguishing between quite a large number of communicative sounds – i.e. they possess quite a wide vocabulary.

Humans also have a very sophisticated means of audial communication and can distinguish quite slight differences in pitch and temporal component of sounds. I hypothesized that perhaps the human brain was potentially ready for echolocation, and one of the reasons why humans did not echolocate was that the frequencies optimal for echolocation lay in the ultrasonic range, inaccessible for our ears and vocal chords. My hypothesis was supported by certain evidence that the visual cortex of blind people might react to audial clues (Thaler, L., et al. (2011). Neural Correlates of Natural Human Echolocation in Early and Late Blind Echolocation Experts. PLoS ONE 6 (5): e20162.). Thus I proposed that if a human being was given the ability to produce and perceive audial signals optimal for echolocation, he/she might echolocate.

There are a number of assistive devices claimed to use the principle of echolocation. Those devices have two main flaws:

1. They are simply ultrasonic distance meters. This means that they produce an ultrasonic pulse and measure time between the production of the pulse and the reception of its reflection, and provide the operator with either a vibration or a pitch proportional to the distance towards an “obstacle”. But what is this obstacle? Is it a tree or a car, or a person? Is it made of something hard like glass, or soft like fabric? Is it situated in a large space, or a corridor, or a small room? Is it moving or stationary? For those devices everything is the same, thus they reduce the multiformity of the world down to an “obstacle”. But the world is not an obstacle; it is a world with a multitude of different objects, possessing different properties, which engage us and interact with us.
2. These devices are descriptive. They provide the operator with a result of their calculations, rather than let the operator make his/her own judgments and decisions and perceive the world around him/herself.


The device, which I have built, is free from these flaws. It lets the operator perceive surrounding space (whether it is a room, a corridor, an open space etc.), the size and texture of surrounding objects (whether they are small or big, made of a hard or soft material) and the speed and direction of moving objects. It lets the operator naturally perceive the world around, virtually compensating for the lost vision by means of ultrasonic echolocation. The flip side of such flexibility and versatility is time. The device relies on neuroplasticity and the adaptive capabilities of the brain; thus it requires substantial learning, which can be compared to learning a language.

Although the preliminary data is rather promising, it is not clear how much time will be needed to learn the skills of performing ultrasonic echolocation fluently. It is not clear to which degree our brain is capable of acquiring such skills. And it is not clear to which degree is it capable of rewiring itself in order to be able to create a visual representation of the world out of audial clues. How the device may influence the life style of the operator is also unclear.
