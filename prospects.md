##Whom the device is made for?

1. The device is primarily made for visually impaired and blind people. It relies on neuroplasticity and substitutes for the lost vision by means of acquiring the skills of ultrasonic echolocation. 
2. Another application of the device is natural audible frequency range extender. The device permits listening to a multitude of sound, which naturally humans cannot hear. Like calls of bats, dolphins, mice, industrial noises etc. – basically **giving the user “the 6th sense”**. 

The main advantage over existing “bat locators” is that the device is binaural and doesn’t block conventional ambient sounds, thus causing in the operator an impression that all the newly acquired multitude of ultrasounds is perceived naturally without an assistance of the device. 

##Goals

At the present moment the device is at the stage of a working prototype. The primary goal is to finish the development and make a finalized version, suitable for retail sale and everyday use. The device requires implementation of a number of necessary features and needs a decent frame design. 

Creating a completely finished specimen of the device will require approximately $90000 (further prototyping, testing, features implementation, frame design).
